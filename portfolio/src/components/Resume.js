           Highly motivated learner with a Bachelors in Biomedical sciences along with a certificate of completion for a full stack Javascript program, all through the University of Washington. I have spent 20 years in school and still can not get enough. I have found a passion for the compexity of computer science and want to explore it more. I decided to undertake a new field of study hoping my love for learning languages would translate over and it has paid off so far. I am excited to get into this field and learn as much as I can.
